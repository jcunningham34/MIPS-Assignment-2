# MIPS-Assignment-2
1st Commit: Altered my MIPS 1 Assingment to create the sub 1 and 2 programs for the requirments. So now the program calls the getlength function to get the length of the user input, and the main calls sub prog 2 to convert the string which calls sub prog 1 to convert each letter.
