# MIPS-Assignment-2
1st Commit: Altered my MIPS 1 Assingment to create the sub 1 and 2 programs for the requirments. So now the program calls the getlength function to get the length of the user input, and the main calls sub prog 2 to convert the string which calls sub prog 1 to convert each letter.
2nd Commit:Debugging and trying to convert single characters correctly. Need to figure a way to convert strings correctly.
3rd Commit:The program can now take any hexadecimal number up to 8 characters with no problemb(with exception errors but still prints correct values from 1-ffffffff). Added Subprogram 3 so now it fulfills the subprogram requirements. Next, I need to find a way to have the program make commas and spaces exceptions
4th Commit: The program can take inputs more than 8 characters (up to 1000) and have made a function to deal with commas within big string. Just need to make the comma function set so that when the program encounters a comma, it prints the total value so far, and then resets all of the registers for the next substring. 
5th Commit: The program can now output correct decimal values with spaces and tabs, now need to work on commas
6th Commit: Program has the comma function and now we just need to debug
