# MIPS-Assignment-2
1st Commit: Altered my MIPS 1 Assingment to create the sub 1 and 2 programs for the requirments. So now the program calls the getlength function to get the length of the user input, and the main calls sub prog 2 to convert the string which calls sub prog 1 to convert each letter.
2nd Commit:Debugging and trying to convert single characters correctly. Need to figure a way to convert strings correctly.
3rd Commit:The program can now take any hexadecimal number up to 8 characters with no problem. Added Subprogram 3 so now it fulfills the subprogram requirements. Next, I need to find a way to have the program make commas and spaces exceptions
